# overpic-example
A small example document for using LaTeX package overpic. I put this example together to help improve the quality of figures in research papers, especially the labeling of subfigures.

**overpic was not written by me at all!**  
It is an awesome package for LaTeX written by [Rolf Niepraschk](https://github.com/rolfn) and [available on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/overpic). If not obvious, I highly recommend you use it!
