# overpic-example
A small example document for using LaTeX package overpic. I put this example together to help improve the quality of figures in research papers, especially annotating/labeling them.

**overpic was not written by me at all!**  
It is an awesome package for LaTeX written by [Rolf Niepraschk](https://github.com/rolfn) and [available on CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/overpic). If not obvious, I highly recommend you use it! Many people prefer using [TikZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGF/TikZ), which is indeed more powerful, but I feel it is overkill for science papers which often just need some clean annotation/labeling support.
